# Buoy

Buoy is a command line application that reports and analyze data collected by buoys around Taiwan.

## Installation

- `git clone` this project to your local file directory
- Run `composer install` to get required components from Packagist.

## Usage

- At project folder root, run `php index.php` to report the buoys at northern Taiwan.
- A list of available buoy station names is presented. Use <space> key to select the stations of interest; <return> key to start the program.
- Buoy data of the last 3 hours are printed, along with the stats (average, max, min, and trend) of the last 8-hour data (wave height, sea temperature, and air temperature) are printed to stdout.

## To-do's

- Let index.php handle all the display rather than the get functions in class
