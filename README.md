# Buoy

Buoy is a command line application that reports and analyze data collected by buoys around Taiwan.

## Installation

- `git clone` this project to your local file directory
- `cd <Buoy Directory>` change to the Buoy directory where composer.json
  resides
- Run `composer install` to get required components from Packagist.

## Usage

- At project folder root, run `php index.php` to report the buoys at northern Taiwan.
- A list of available buoy station names is presented. Use <space> key to select one station of interest; <return> key to display its report.
- Buoy data of the last 3 hours are printed, along with the stats (default to average and trend) of the last 8-hour data (wave height, sea temperature, and air temperature) are printed to stdout.
- A confirmation dialog follows. Select 'y' to repeat buoy selection; 'n' to quit the program.
